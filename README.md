## Task statement  
Create an enterprise-grade "city list" application (it will stay there for years, will be extended and maintained) which allows the user to do the following:  
* browse through the paginated list of cities with the corresponding photos  
* search by the name  
* edit the city (both name and photo)  

## Notes  
* initial list of cities should be populated using the attached cities.csv file  
* city addition, deletion and sorting are not in the scope of this task  

## Technical clarification  
* Spring Boot  
* any build system  
* any database  
* any frontend stack  
* Usage of Spring Data REST is prohibited  

## Bonus points (not mandatory)  
* Frontend stack should be one from the list below:  
  * Angular  
  * VueJS  
  * React  
* Editing the city should be only allowed for users with Spring Security's role `ROLE_ALLOW_EDIT`  

## Expected outcome  
A repository link to your GitHub account from where you can clone the solution and run it with little-to-zero effort.  
Should you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact the sender of this task.
